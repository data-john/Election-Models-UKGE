## 🐛 Issues Resolved During Sprint 2

### Critical Issues (Sprint Blocking)
- **✅ I4**: Fixed Streamlit dataframe `width=None` deployment error
- **✅ I5**: Implemented pollster name cleaning to remove Wikipedia references

### Quality Issues  
- **✅ I1**: Fixed Wikipedia date parsing for accurate "days ago" calculation
- **✅ I2**: Resolved Streamlit API deprecation warnings
- **✅ I3**: Fixed chart color consistency between cards and trend graph

### Outstanding Issues for Sprint 3
- **I6**: Multiple averages for same date (polling trend optimization)

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Quality Assurance
- **Test Coverage**: 110 tests (96 existing + 14 Sprint 2 specific)
- **Test Pass Rate**: 100% (110/110 passing)
- **Error Scenarios**: 25+ edge cases tested and handled

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Wikipedia Scraping**: 3-6 seconds (first time), <1s (cached)
- **Data Processing**: <1 second for 20-25 polls  
- **Chart Rendering**: 1-2 seconds for interactive Altair charts
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 95%+ during development

## 🛠 Technical Architecture Established

### Data Pipeline
```
Wikipedia → HTML Parser → Data Validator → SQLite Cache → UI Display
                ↓              ↓              ↓            ↓
           Error Handler → Logger → Fallback Data → User Feedback
```

### Key Components
1. **polls.py**: Wikipedia scraping and data processing
2. **cache_manager.py**: SQLite-based caching with TTL
3. **app.py**: Streamlit UI with interactive components  
4. **logging_config.py**: Production logging and monitoring
