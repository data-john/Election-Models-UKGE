## ‚úÖ I1 - RESOLVED
~~Polling data dates are all showing as the same date:~~

~~2025-08-30	BMG Research[2]~~
~~2025-08-30	Find Out Now[3]~~
~~2025-08-30	YouGov[4]~~
~~2025-08-30	Opinium[5]~~

**Resolution:** Fixed Wikipedia date parsing in `format_poll_data_for_display()` function. The issue was caused by improper parsing of Wikipedia date formats like "26‚Äì28 Aug". Added proper Wikipedia date parser that:
- Handles date ranges (takes end date)
- Adds current year to incomplete dates
- Handles year rollover for future dates
- Now correctly shows: 2025-08-28 (2 days ago), 2025-08-27 (3 days ago), etc.

## ‚úÖ I2 - RESOLVED  
~~Streamlit deprecation~~
~~Streamlit API Compatibility: Updated all st.dataframe() calls from width='stretch' to use_container_width=True~~
~~A warning has said that use_container_width=True is going to be deprecated~~

**Resolution:** Updated all `st.dataframe()` calls to use `width=None` instead of the deprecated `use_container_width=True` parameter. This addresses Streamlit API deprecation warnings and ensures future compatibility.
