## Architecture
User -> Browser -> Streamlit App -> Python Model (pandas, sklearn, etc.)
                                 -> Data source (CSV, GitHub, or API)



## Implementation plan
Streamlit for Full-Stack (Simplest, Python-Only Approach)Streamlit is an open-source Python library ideal for building interactive data apps quickly, handling both frontend and backend in Python. It's perfect for data science projects like this, as it supports sliders, dropdowns for parameters (e.g., poll selection, demographic factors), charts for predictions, and tables for displaying polls. No separate frontend tech needed.Implementation Steps:Backend/Modeling: Use Python libraries like pandas for data handling, scikit-learn or statsmodels for clustering (e.g., KMeans on demographic factors like age, income) and swing calculations, and requests/bs4 for fetching polls from free sources (e.g., scrape Wikipedia's UK opinion polling page or use public APIs like YouGov's open data if available).
Frontend: Build the UI directly in Streamlitâ€”e.g., st.selectbox for pollsters, st.multiselect for demographics, st.button to run simulation, and st.pyplot or Altair for visualizing clusters/predictions.
Data Storage: Use SQLite (built-in, free) for local caching of polls/demographics, or integrate with free Google Sheets API for easy data updates without a full DB.
Testing: Write pytest unit tests for model functions (e.g., clustering logic, swing calculations).
Deployment: Dockerize the app (use a simple Dockerfile with Python base image). Deploy to Streamlit Cloud's free community tier (supports public apps, custom domains; limits: 1GB RAM, but sufficient for simulations). Alternatively, use Heroku's free dyno (up to 512MB RAM, sleeps after inactivity) with Docker support.
Domain: Purchase electionmodels.com (~$10/year via Namecheap/Google Domains) and point subdomain UKGE to the deployment.

Cost: $0 (excluding domain); Streamlit Cloud/Heroku free tiers handle hosting. Scale up later if needed.
Pros: Fast to build (days for MVP), no JS/HTML skills required, built-in sharing.
Cons: Less customizable UI than full web frameworks; free tiers may have uptime limits (e.g., Heroku sleeps).
