# UK Election Simulator

## Summary
A website that allows the user to customise election model parameters and see their predicted output. Ideally, the website should show all recent polls and the user can select any poll or combination of pollsters to feed into the model. Also they can choose which demographic factors will be influential and therefore which factors are used to cluster constituencies together for modelling. The clusters are used by the model in combination with stratified polling data to calculate a per cluster expected swing using demographic factors.

## Technologies
Cloud deployment of python project using docker. 
Unit tests using pytest
Frontend is more technology ambiguous
